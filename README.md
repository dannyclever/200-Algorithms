# 200-Algorithms

## 200+Algorithms solved in JavaScript

This is a project with a sequence of 200 algorithms and perhaps more solved in the JavaScript programming language.
Some algorithms here presented 2 ways of solving in order to train my daily skills and also help others with solutions of these same algorithms.
